# Project Proposal COSC 360

Group List:
- Sebi Unipan
- Owen Spicker
- Amritpal Aujla

Project description: Our team will make a discussion board type of website. Our site will look similar to reddit in functionality and design.

What our site will do: The site will allow users to create a thread about a main topic in mind, and allow other users to comment on that topic. Users should be able to browse the website with or without registering, as well as perform searches to find topics of interest. Once registered and signed in, users will be able to create and comment on threads. Users will have their own user page where they will be able to edit their display profile. Creating a user on the website will be simple, just a name and password with an optional photo. Forgotten password recovery will be supported.  Administrators will have the power to delete/edit comments or an entire thread if they donâ€™t like it. They will also have the ability to disable user accounts entirely, as well as enable them.

Deliverables: 
- A decently styled page, consistent across website
- An error free experience 
- Easy navigation
- Have the site save user inputs so when reloaded or revisited content is not lost
- Minimal functional requirements
- Effective database queries
- Reliable error handling
- Switch between states(logged in/ logged out)
